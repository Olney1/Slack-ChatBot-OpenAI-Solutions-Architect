# Slack ChatBot Tech-Support - OpenAI Solutions Architect

This repository demonstrates a powerful application for OpenAI's GPT-3 model, tailored to meet the needs of solutions architects. The application uses a chatbot that is designed to provide tech support within an organization. 

Based on a context defined by the architect for example, the chatbot is capable of diagnosing and troubleshooting a wide range of software and hardware issues, interacting with specific systems or applications, and providing detailed instructions to users, specifically tailored to the organisation IT use case. The application is built with FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)
- ngrok (for local testing)

You will also need the following API keys and secrets. These should be stored securely, for instance, in environment variables:

- OpenAI API key
- Slack Bot token
- Slack Bot user ID

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Olney1/Slack-ChatBot-Tech-Support---OpenAI---Solutions-Architect.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**

   ```
   cd Slack-ChatBot-Tech-Support---OpenAI---Solutions-Architect
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Start FastAPI server**

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Expose your local server to the internet with ngrok**

   In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where ngrok is installed and start a tunnel on the same port as the FastAPI application (default is 8000).

   ```
   ./ngrok http 8000
   ```

   Note the https URL ngrok provides. This is the public URL you can use to interact with your local FastAPI application.

3. **Add the ngrok URL as a Slack Event Subscription**

   Go to your app settings page on the Slack API site and navigate to 'Event Subscriptions'. Enable events, then paste the ngrok URL in the 'Request URL' box. Append `/slack/events` to the end of this URL.

## Testing

You can send a POST request to the `/slack/events` endpoint with a JSON body representing a Slack event to test the application. The application should respond by posting a message in the designated Slack channel with the tech support response.

## Customizing the Chatbot

The real power of this application lies in the ability for solutions architects to customize the chatbot based on the specific needs of an organization or a user group. The context that the chatbot uses to generate responses can be defined, which allows tailoring the chatbot's responses to address specific problems, handle particular systems or applications, and align with the knowledge base of the target users. This makes it a versatile and powerful tool for automated, context-aware tech support.
